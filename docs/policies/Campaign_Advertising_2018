Dear Party Secretary
Updated guidance on authorising the communication of electoral,
referendum and political matter
As you would be aware, there have recently been changes to the rules that apply when authorising
communications containing electoral, referendum or political matter, including federal electoral
advertisements (‘electoral communications’). I am writing to draw your attention to the updated AEC
Electoral Backgrounder that is now available on the AEC’s website at www.aec.gov.au/advertising.
The Electoral Backgrounder, Electoral communications and authorisation requirements has been
updated to clarify what constitutes the authorisation of an electoral communication; who will be the
notifying entity for the purpose of authorising an electoral communication; and authorisation
particulars that are required on an electoral communication.
On 15 March 2018, the Electoral and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2017 replaced the former
authorisation requirements with new authorisation requirements in Part XXA in the Commonwealth
Electoral Act 1918, and the accompanying Commonwealth Electoral (Authorisation of Voter
Communication) Determination 2018.
The new authorisation requirements were established to enhance the transparency of the electoral
system by allowing voters to know who is making an electoral communication, and to ensure that
persons making electoral communications are accountable for their communications and that those
persons can be traced if there are any breaches of the new requirements.
Under the new rules, the form of an authorisation for an electoral communication will depend on the
type of communication and the person or entity who is authorising the communication. The new rules
extend the former authorisation requirements to modern communication channels and methods,
including online platforms, bulk text messages and robo-calls.
The Electoral Act is available on the Federal Register of Legislation here:
www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018C00062. The Determination and Explanatory Statement are
available on the Federal Register of Legislation here: www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2018L00139.
